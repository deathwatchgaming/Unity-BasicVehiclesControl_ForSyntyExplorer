Jeep01 Speedometer Setup Steps:
----------------------------------------


Note: these instructions steps found below are for the script provided that is
for usage with the vehicle entry script applied. Ok, noting that if you only
followed the vehicle setup steps to use vehicle controller and not vehicle
entry additions after and now you want to add the vehicle speedometer then
you need the *Controller-Only-Speedometer script for that specifc to the
vehicle controller you are using instead.



Manual Setup Instruction:
-------------------------

* Simply follow the instruction for manual setup found below.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: In Interface > Canvas create empty child: "VehiclesSpeed"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In: "VehiclesSpeed"

Adjust:

Rect Transform:
---------------

Bottom Left

Pos X: 146.3
Pos Y: 143

Width: 300
Height: 300


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: In "VehiclesSpeed" create empty child: "Jeep01Speedometer"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In "Jeep01Speedometer"

Adjust:

Rect Transform:
---------------

Middle Center

Width: 300
Height: 300

* something to note on placement: ok, when you add the script later in steps
  you will notice an option in script settings for setting on choice of
  either kph or mph in regards to SpeedText output, ok, with taking that into
  account you can now possibly understand the following note about placement
  of the interface items specific to such, mkay lets say that these setup
  steps suggest setting all on the bottom left and that is because we are
  using mph for the speed text output display thus such would make sense to
  have speedometer and speed text on left bottom, but, ok, say you select kph
  as speed text output, then it just might make sence to set the interface
  items to the bottom right and that is why these suggestions are mentioned.
  The choice is yours on that.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: In Interface > Canvas > VehiclesSpeed add UI IMG: "Jeep01_SpeedoGuage"

Note: Lastly, disable this object as we do not want this to display prior to
awake or start methods and to do this we will disable this object by default
and then there is a wrapper in the script that will find the inactive item in
start thus doing what will be needed. So yeah, make sure to disable this
object in the editor.
